(1) [Shaffer, Exercise 5.18] Write a function that prints out the node
values for a binary tree in sorted order from highest to lowest.  You can
assume that the tree satisfies the Binary Search Tree Property.

(2) [Shaffer, Exercise 5.20] Write a recursive function named printRange
that, given the pointer to the root of a BST, a low key value, and a high
key value, prints in sorted order all records whose key values fall
between the two given keys. It should visit as few nodes in the BST
as possible.

(3) [Shaffer, Exercise 5.21] Write a recursive function naked checkBST
that, given the pointer to the root of a binary tree, will return true
if and only if the tree satisfies the Binary Search Tree Property.
