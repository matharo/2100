McCOY: Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation that's in there!
SPOCK: But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
McCOY: You're not going in there!
SPOCK: Perhaps you're right. What is Mister Scott's condition?
McCOY: Well, I don't think that he...
(Spock administers a Vulcan nerve pinch on McCoy)
SPOCK: I'm sorry, Doctor. I have no time to discuss this logically. ...Remember!
SCOTT: Spock! Get out of there! Spock!

[Enterprise reactor room]

SCOTT (OC): Spock! Get out of there!

[Enterprise bridge]

KIRK: Time from my mark.
SAAVIK: Two minutes, ten seconds.
KIRK: Engine room! What's happening?

[Enterprise reactor room]

SCOTT: You dumb ninny! Get out of there! ...No, God, don't!

[Enterprise bridge]

KIRK: Time?
SAAVIK: Three minutes, thirty seconds.
KIRK: Distance from Reliant.
CHEKOV: Four hundred kilometres.
SULU: We're not going to make it, are we?

[Reliant bridge]

KHAN: No! ...No! You can't get away. ...from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee.

[Enterprise bridge]

CADET: Sir! The mains are back on line!
KIRK: Bless you, Scotty. Go, Sulu!
(Regula I explodes as Enterprise flees the radiating Genesis rings)

[Enterprise bridge]

KIRK: My God, Carol. Look at it. ...Engine Room. Well done. Scotty?
McCOY (on intercom): Jim, I think you'd better get down here.
KIRK: Bones?
McCOY (on intercom): Better hurry!
KIRK: Saavik, take the con.

[Enterprise engineering]

McCOY: No! You'll flood the whole compartment!
KIRK: He'll die!
SCOTT: Sir! He's dead already.
McCOY: It's too late, Jim.
KIRK: Spock!
SPOCK: Ship ...out of danger?
KIRK: Yes.
SPOCK: Don't grieve, Admiral, ...it is logical. The needs of the many ...outweigh
KIRK: ...the needs of the few.
SPOCK: Or the one. ... I never took the Kobayashi Maru test ...until now. What do you think of my solution?
KIRK: Spock!
SPOCK: I have been ...and always shall be ...your friend. ...Live long ...and prosper.
KIRK: No!
